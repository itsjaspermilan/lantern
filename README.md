# Lantern

A console-style home screen for the Retroid Pocket 6 (landscape, 1920x1080, gamepad first).
Each game is its own tile: emulated ROMs, Android games and Nova games alike. Replaces the stock launcher.

Plan, mockup and decisions: the "Lantern Launcher" artifact (https://claude.ai/artifact/DCNUKbUBFy1EsoYeDYZzCY).

## Status: M0 done, M1 started

The home screen follows the mockup (1920x1080 layout numbers, scaled to the window): three shelves
(Recent, Favourites, All games) on L1/R1, one row of covers where the focused cover grows, a glow behind
it in the game's colours, the title block, and the button hints.

- Games come from ROM folders (`/sdcard/Lantern/roms/<system>/`, needs "all files access") and from installed Android apps.
- D-pad browses, A opens an Android app, Y favourites, Start opens the file-access setting if needed.
- Favourites and play history are kept in the app's preferences.
- Covers are generated from the game's colours. Real art fetching is not built.

Not done yet: art fetching, game pages, the Systems shelf, the built-in libretro player and its menu.
A on a ROM only shows a message. The shelf creates one view per game, so a library of hundreds needs recycling.
Not verified: anything on the real device. Only checked on the `retroid-sim` emulator, which keeps system bars
on screen (the layout fits what the window leaves). The D-pad is handled as key events only; stick or hat
motion events are not handled yet.

## Build

No Gradle. `build.sh` runs javac, d8, aapt2, zipalign and apksigner from the Android SDK.

    ./build.sh            # build/lantern-debug.apk
    ./build.sh install    # and install on the connected device or emulator

If your shell uses asdf shims for Java, run it through a shell that sets `JAVA_HOME`
(the script puts `$JAVA_HOME/bin` first on PATH). For example Nova's `scripts/env.sh ./build.sh install`.

Make it the home screen on an emulator:

    adb shell cmd package set-home-activity app.lantern/.HomeActivity

## Later

Moving to Gradle, Kotlin and Compose needs downloads (Gradle, Kotlin, AndroidX). Do that when the UI outgrows plain Views.
The built-in player's native host is a separate decision (see the plan).
